### Arithmetic Operators

*  **+** Addition
*  **-** Subtraction
*  *  Multiplication
*  **/** Division
*  **%** Mod (the remainder after dividing)
*  **  Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
*  **//** Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

```py
print(3 + 5) # 8
print(1 + 2 + 3 * 3) # 12
print(3 ** 2) # 9
print(9 % 2) # 1
```
